# DONE: 1. (3 pts)
#
#   For this module, we are going to create a basic program to handle movie
#   times at a movie theater. For our purposes, a movie is going to be defined
#   as a dictionary with these keys:
#       - title
#       - duration
#       - start_time
#       - theater_num
#       - num_of_tickets
#
#   For this __todo__, write a function called show_movies() that takes one
#   argument:
#       - movies     <-- list of dictionaries (movies)
#
#   First, it should print the line:
#       Movies:
#   
#   Then, This function should loop through the list of movies and, for each
#   movie, print information about the movie like so:
#
#       Title: Braveheart
#       Duration: 170 minutes
#       Start Time: 2:15 PM
#       Theater: 8
#       Tickets Available: 20
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.

def show_movies(movies):
    print("\nMovies:")
    for movie in movies:
            print("Title:" , movie.get("title"))
            print("Duration:" , movie.get("duration"))
            print("Start Time:" , movie.get("start_time"))
            print("Theater:" , movie.get("theater_num"))
            print("Number of Tickets:" , movie.get("num_of_tickets"))
        
###############################################################################
# DONE: 2. (3 pts)
#
#   For this _todo_, write a function called get_ticket() that takes one
#   parameter:
#       - movie      <-- dictionary (movie)
#
#   This function should behave like this:
#
#       - If the movie has tickets available (that is, it is greater than 0), it
#         should set the value of num_of_tickets to one less than what it was
#         before and print:
#           "Success! You know have a ticket for <MOVIE TITLE HERE>!"
#       - If the movie's num_of_tickets value is not greater than 0 (that is,
#         it is there are not tickets available), it should print:
#           "There are currently no tickets available for that movie."
#
#   HINT: Remember that you will need to convert the number of tickets to an
#   integer
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.

def get_ticket(movie):
    if movie["num_of_tickets"] > 0:
        movie["num_of_tickets"]="num_of_tickets" - 1

    else:
        print("There are currently no tickets available for that movie.")

# DONE: 3. (9 pts)
#
#   Now, let's create our movie showtimes system.
#
#   For this _todo_, write a function called main() that will start things off.
#   This function should do these things in order:
#
#       1. Print a welcome message to the user
#       2. Continually ask the user for information about movies (title,
#          duration (in minutes), start time, theater number, tickets
#          available). If the user types "end" for any of the fields, the
#          program should stop asking for movie information. (HINT: I used a
#          while loop)
#       3. For each movie, create a dictionary to hold the movie's information.
#          The dictionary should have all of this information: title, duration,
#          start_time, theater_num, num_of_tickets.
#       4. It should keep track of all the movies in a list.
#       5. Once the user stops entering movie information, the program should
#          use the show_movies() function to print the list of movies and their
#          information.
#       6. Then, the program should continually prompt the user like so:
#           "Which movie would you like to buy a ticket for? "
#       7. If the user types a movie title that is in the list of movies, it
#          should get a ticket for the user (using the get_ticket() function)
#          and reprint the list of movies with the updated information. It
#          should keep asking the user for more movies to get tickets for until
#          they type "end".
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
